# LEDMatrix64-Arduino
This is an arduino library I developed for this 64x32 bit LED display I bought from Aliexpress.

# The Display
The LED display I bought on Aliexpress had very little information online. All I knew is that it had an HUB08 interface, which also had very little documentation. Below is the display with the item description:

# Credits
I tried to use several libraries, but ended up combining a few to make my own. These are the libraries I used:
